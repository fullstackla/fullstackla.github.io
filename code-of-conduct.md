Code of Conduct
===============

**PURPOSE**

Fullstack LA provides: 

> *a <strong>harassment-free community</strong> and learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We expect all attendees to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout &#91;Fullstack LA&#93; classes and events. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any &#91;Fullstack LA&#93; event. &#91;Fullstack LA&#93; participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from our events or online discussion boards at the discretion of the event organizers.*

**HARASSMENT**

Harassment includes: 

+ offensive verbal comments related to 
    - gender, 
    - gender identity and expression, 
    - sexual orientation, 
    - disability, 
    - physical appearance, 
    - body size, 
    - race, or 
    - religion; 
+ sexual images in public spaces; 
+ deliberate intimidation; 
+ stalking; 
+ following; 
+ harassing photography or recording; 
+ sustained disruption of talks or other events; 
+ inappropriate physical contact; and 
+ unwelcome sexual attention. 

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

**PRIVACY CONCERNS**

Your privacy is important to us. While photographs may be taken in class and can be shared by group members in the groupâ€™s meetup page, *no photograph shall be used for promotional purposes without verbal and/or written consent of the attendees.* If a group photograph is taken, your participation will serve as your agreement to the use of such a photograph for &#91;Fullstack LA&#93; promotional purposes. *<strong>If you are uncomfortable having your photograph shared</strong>, please let us know.*

**USE OF SEXUALIZED IMAGERY**

Teachers, event organizers, volunteers, and hosts are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, teachers/hosts/organizers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. &#91;FSLA&#93; organizers, teachers, teachers assistants, and event hosts (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

**CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR**

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the &#91;Fullstack LA&#93; organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the class/event/meetup group.
