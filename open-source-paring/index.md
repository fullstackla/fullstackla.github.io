# Open Source Paring

Contribute to the open source community!

## Date

Join us for Open Source Pair Programming. Get ready to roll up your sleeves
 and get to the code. Everyone is encouraged to improve open source projects
 and submit a pull requests. If you're a seasoned open source
 committer/maintainer, we love you, come show us how it's done
 (we are a truly captive audience). If you have never pushed code to an open
 source project, you have come to the right place. We are here to help you
 find projects, identify issues, and understand the process of pull down,
 building, and pushing up new code.

All the coding is done in pairs, so you're never without someone to code with.
 Pair programing with new people is a great way to make new friends. Friends
 are welcome, but be ready to pair with new ones.

While everyone is welcome, it is recommended that you have done some coding in
 the past. With coding, the first few steps can be the hardest. We are happy
 to assist everyone at all levels. The focus of this group is on open source
 contributions and getting folks past the first, tenth and hundredth pull
 request.

 programing is all about collaboration and it sucks when Vim gets in the way.
