<p>Are you ready to roll up your sleeves and contribute to open source?!!!</p>

<p>Fullstack LA Open Source is a bi-weekly event focused on contributing to
 open source software and leveling up 💪 our skills.</p>

<p>At every meetup, we invite people from the open source community to come in and give us a brief introduction on their project and how people can contribute.</p>

<p>Afterwards we immediately break into groups and focus on either the guest speaker's open source project, or other projects Fullstack LA members are already developing.</p>

<p>Fullstack LA is currently obsessed 💓 with <a href="http://exercism.io/" target="_blank">exercism.io</a>, <a href="http://hood.ie/" target="_blank">Hood.ie</a>, and the <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> open source projects.</p>

<p>Basically, if your organization is about open source, then <a href="{{base.url}}/rfp">we want to hear from you!</a></p>
